✔️NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

✔️It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

✔️NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

✔️NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

✔️NumPy is usually imported under the `np` alias.

📍NumPy Creating Arrays:

✔️NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`. 
We can create a NumPy `ndarray` object by using the `array()` function.

✔️To create an `ndarray`, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the
`array()` method, and it will be converted into an `ndarray`:
```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

📍Dimensions in Arrays:

✔️A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).
