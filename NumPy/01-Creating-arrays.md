📍NumPy Creating Arrays:

✔️NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`. 
We can create a NumPy `ndarray` object by using the `array()` function.

✔️To create an `ndarray`, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the
`array()` method, and it will be converted into an `ndarray`:
```python
import numpy as np

arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```
